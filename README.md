### YOLOv8 and DeepSORT Object Detection and Tracking

This repository implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using **YOLOv8** for detection and **DeepSORT** for tracking. The system detects and tracks objects (such as persons and motorcycles) in video streams, assigning unique IDs to each detected object for continuous tracking. The output is a video with bounding boxes and track IDs displayed around the objects.

#### Features

- Real-time object detection with YOLOv8
- Multi-object tracking with DeepSORT
- Outputs video with bounding boxes and unique track IDs
- Supports various object classes (e.g., person, motorcycle)
- Suitable for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and object counting applications
